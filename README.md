Food Transport Robot Project

Overview

This project aims to design and implement a robot capable of transporting food items from one warehouse to another without human intervention. The system improves efficiency, reduces human error, and increases operational speed.

Objectives
 • Automate the process of transporting food items.
 • Reduce dependence on human labor.
 • Ensure high speed and accuracy in transportation.
 • Improve warehouse management and reduce waste.

Execution Algorithm
 1. Preparation:
 • Receive the transportation order from the central system.
 • Identify the location of the food items in the first warehouse.
 2. Navigate to Pickup Point:
 • Move the robot using sensors and navigation algorithms to avoid obstacles.
 • Stop precisely at the pickup location.
 3. Pickup Items:
 • Use a robotic arm or lifting mechanism to grab the items.
 • Ensure the load is securely held.
 4. Transport to Target Warehouse:
 • Determine the optimal path using stored maps or computer vision.
 • Move at a safe speed while carrying the load.
 5. Unload Items:
 • Place the items in the designated location inside the target warehouse.

Robot Design
 • Base: Mobile platform with wheels or tracks for movement.
 • Sensors: Lidar, ultrasonic, and cameras for navigation and obstacle detection.
 • Manipulator: Robotic arm or lift system for handling goods.
 • Controller: Microcontroller or onboard computer for processing and control.
 • Power Source: Rechargeable battery system.

Working Envelope Elements
 • Horizontal Range: Maximum distance the robot can travel laterally in the workspace.
 • Vertical Range: Maximum height the manipulator can reach.
 • Load Capacity: Maximum weight the robot can carry safely.
 • Operational Area: Defined paths and zones within both warehouses where the robot can operate.
 • Reachability: Ability to access shelves, pallets, or storage areas.
